## Project Data

1. Project description: <br>

   Open States strives to improve civic engagement at the state level by providing data and tools regarding state legislatures. They aim to serve members of the public, activist groups, journalists, and researchers with better data on what is happening in their state capital, and to provide tools to reduce barriers to participation and increase engagement.

   Open States aggregates legislative information from all 50 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico. This information is then standardized, cleaned, and published to the public via OpenStates.org, a powerful API, and bulk downloads.

   Bill, vote, legislator, and committee data is collected from official sources.

## License

1. What is the project's license? <br>

   GNU General Public License v3.0

## Code Base

1. What is the primary programming language in the project?

   Python

1. What is the development environment? <br>

   We need to set up a docker environment on our local machine.

1. Are there instructions for how to download, build, and install? How easy is it to find them? Do they seem easy (relatively speaking) to follow? <br>

   The instructions for how to download, build and install are very detailed. They explains the installation process step by step with links, commands and notes, so they are easy to follow. They also have examples that walk you through the whole working process and an overview of their project's file structure, which is very helpful.

1. Does the project depend on external additional software modules such as
   database, graphics, web development, or other libraries? If so, are there clear instructions on how to install those? <br>

   Yes, and the instructions are clear and easy to follow along.

1. Is the code easy to understand? Browse some source code files and make
   a judgment based on your random sample. <br>

   I think for someone who is familiar with python or has experience with scraping data, it might be easy to understand. For me personally, it's not easy.

1. Is this a big project? If you can, find out about how many lines of code
   are in it, perhaps on [OpenHub](https://www.openhub.net/). <br>

   29.3K lines of code. This is a big project.

1. Does the repository have tests? If so, are the code contributors expected to write tests for newly added code? <br>

The repository does not have tests and contributors are not expected to write tests, but contributors are free to test their own codes.

## Summary

1.  Do you think this is a project to which it would be possible to contribute
    in the course of a few weeks before the end of this semester? <br>

    Yes. I think this would be possible to contribute in the course of a few weeks because the project is very active and the team is helpful; the pull requests are merged very quickly and the issues are responded within few days. There is not many people contributing to the project so I think it is relatively easier to get help if we encounter problem. The project is written 99.9% in python, so for people who are comfortable with python, this is a good project.

1.  Would you be interested in contributing to this particular project? <br>

    No, because writing code in python will be challenging to me and I am not that interested in scraping data.
