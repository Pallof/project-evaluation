## Code Base


1. What is the primary programming language in the project?
	The primary language is Python. 95 percent is written in python and 5 percent is written in C.

1. What is the development environment? <br>
	<!--
	For example, is it Gnu C++ on Linux?
	Is it a Windows 10 application? Does one need to develop in a virtual machine?
	-->
	According the the project website, if a use plans to work on this project regularly, they should do they development in a python virtual enviornment. Depending on the pythong distribution, you must use conda or virtualenvwrapper.

1. Are there instructions for how to download, build, and install? How easy is it
to find them? Do they seem easy (relatively speaking) to follow? <br>
	The instructions to install Astropy is very easy to find as it is located on the homepage. The installation instructions contains a link to Anaconda Python Distribution. This website leads to the anaconda website where you can download python and astropy. Then instructions go on to exaplain how to update the package. The instructions are fairly easy to follow and to find since its the first thing to be seen. 
 
1. Does the project depend on external additional software modules such as
database,  graphics, web development, or other libraries? If so, are there clear instructions on how to install those? <br>
	Astopy has three strict requirements, which are Python 3.6 or later, Numpy 1.16.0 or later, and pytest 3.1 or later. 
	Astropy can also depend of other packages for optional features. 

1. Is the code easy to understand? Browse some source code files and make
a judgment based on your random sample. <br>
	The code is easy to understand. I am familiar with python, so I am able to follow along. Also, the code snippets that I looked at seemed well written and are clean code. Also, the source code is well documented. THere ae a lot comments explaining what the code is doing.

1. Is this a big project? If you can, find out about how many lines of code
are in it, perhaps on [OpenHub](https://www.openhub.net/). <br>
	This project comtains 151,734 lines of code, so this is a big project. According to Openhub, this project took an estimated 39 years of effort, starting in 2011 up until very recently. 

1. Does the repository have tests? If so, are the code contributors expected to write tests for newly added code? <br>
	There is a file in the Github repository called pytest-astropy, where you can test you code. Code contributors are not required to write code. 


## Code and Design Documentation
1. Is there clear documentation in the code itself? <br>
	Yes, the source code is well documented and is clear.
