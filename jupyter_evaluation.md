## Summary
1. Do you think  this is a project to which it would be possible to contribute
in the course of a few weeks before the end of this semester? <br>

	I think that Jupyter would be a good project for first contributions. There are many issues that need work, and they are all labeled clearly. The code (from what I looked at) is concise and well documented.

2. Would you be interested in contributing to this particular project? <br>

	I would be interested in contributing to this project. I have used Jupyter in classes at NYU and at an internship, and my strongest language is Python.
