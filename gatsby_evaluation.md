## License

- What is the project's license?<br>[MIT](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/blob/master/LICENSE)<br>



## Code Base

- What is the primary programming language in the project?<br>
		JavaScript (93.9%)

-  What is the development environment? <br>
		Node.js and Git

- Are there instructions for how to download, build, and install? How easy is it
  to find them? Do they seem easy (relatively speaking) to follow? <br>
	Yes. It is super easy to find andf follow since Gatsby's second tab is the Tutorials which help the users set up the environment step-by-step. The tutorial is very well-organized also.

- Does the project depend on external additional software modules such as
  database,  graphics, web development, or other libraries? If so, are there clear instructions on how to install those? <br>

  No. Gatsby sets up everything for the users already.

- Is the code easy to understand? Browse some source code files and make
  a judgment based on your random sample. <br>

  Yes. I viewed several files and they are all documented detaily. Especially in files in examples folder, the number of total lines of documentation seems even more than the one of the actual code. Nonetheless, some files are code-only, which means they are lack of any documentation. But again, the code itself is still clear and easy for understanding.

- Is this a big project? If you can, find out about how many lines of code
  are in it, perhaps on [OpenHub](https://www.openhub.net/). <br>

  I think so. On OpenHub, it says Gatsby has 172K lines of code.

- Does the repository have tests? If so, are the code contributors expected to write tests for newly added code? <br>

    Yes and yes. In [e2e-tests](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/e2e-tests)'s README.md, it says the tests are automatically run whenever the *packages/* or *e2e-tests/* directory is changed in a commit.



## Code and Design Documentation
- Is there clear documentation in the code itself? <br>Yes.
- Is there documentation about the design?  <br>Yes. There are layout related files, for example, [click me](starters/default/src/components/layout.css).

## Welcomeness and Community

- Is there a CONTRIBUTING document? If so, how easy to read and understand is it?
Look through it and see if it is clear and thorough. <br>Yes. There are so many ways to contribute and each of them are easy to follow with documentation.

- Is there a CODE OF CONDUCT document? Does it have consequences for acts that violate it? <br>Yes. Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the  Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent  repercussions as determined by other members of the projectâ€™s  leadership.<br>

  When faced with repeated bad faith comments or harassment after an earnest attempt to mediate an issue, the Gatsby team reserves the right to remove someone from the GitHub  repository and/or block them on social media. This decision will always  be made with consensus from more than one team member. ([Reference](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/contributing/code-of-conduct/))

- Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues?
Are responses generally constructive? Read the issue conversations. <br>Yes. I checked multiple closed issues, and most of them are ended with a big thanks. 

- Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat? <br>Yes.

- Do maintainers thank people for their contributions? <br>Yes.




## Development Environment Installation

Install the development environment for the project on your system.
Describe the process that you needed to follow:

- how involved was the process? <br>I could not install it successfully since it says there is a permission problem. But I upgraded my git...

- how long it take you? <br>It took me a while since I have to update my git version. But installing Gatsby CLI did not take a long time.

- did you need to install additional packages or libraries? <br>No.

- were you able to build the code following the instructions? <br>No.

- did you need to look for additional help in installing the environment? <br>Yes (for updating git).

- any other comments? <br>I could not directly download the latest verision of git and there is always a permission error while I was installing Gatsby CLI.




## Summary
- Do you think this is a project to which it would be possible to contribute
in the course of a few weeks before the end of this semester? <br>From my installing exprience, I believe so. It might need to present how to deal with the errors that might appear during installing process, which we can contribute to it.
	
- Would you be interested in contributing to this particular project? <br>This project appeals to me since I'm very interested in web development and I took Applied Internet Technology last semester which provided me basics about Node.js. Also, it is a great opportunity for me to familiar myself with React.js which I barely know.
