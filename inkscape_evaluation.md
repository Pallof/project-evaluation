## Project Data

1. Project description: <br>
<!--
What is the purpose of this project? What does the code do? What type of users
does it have?
-->
	Inkscape is a vector graphics software and is used by design professionals and others to create a graphics such as illustrations, icons, logos, diagrams, maps, and web graphics.

2. Project website/homepage:
	https://inkscape.org/

3. Project repository:
	https://gitlab.com/inkscape/inkscape



## License

1. What is the project's license? <br>
<!--
In most repositories there will be a file named LICENSE or something similar in
the root level of the repository. This is the one to examine. There may be
different licenses on specific files, but the project will have a main license.
-->
	GNU General Public License 


## Code Base


1. What is the primary programming language in the project?
	C++

2. What is the development environment? <br>
	<!--
	For example, is it Gnu C++ on Linux?
	Is it a Windows 10 application? Does one need to develop in a virtual machine?
	-->
	Linux, Mac OS, and Windows

3. Are there instructions for how to download, build, and install? How easy is it
to find them? Do they seem easy (relatively speaking) to follow? <br>
	There are instructions for downloading, building, and installing. They can be found on the website or in the repository. They are fairly straightforward and easily accessible. They also have wiki links that could be helpful. 

4. Does the project depend on external additional software modules such as
database,  graphics, web development, or other libraries? If so, are there clear instructions on how to install those? <br>
	Yes, there are various other external libraries that you need to install. The Gitlab repository does specify that Boehm-GC,libsigc++, and gtkmm are needed. They do provide instructions on how to install them and have links that could be helpful for beginners.

5. Is the code easy to understand? Browse some source code files and make
a judgment based on your random sample. <br>
	The code is well documented making it easier to understand the code. From the code that I read it seems as though you should have a good understanding of computer graphics in order to fully understand the code. According to Inkscape's website, in order to be able to contribute to their codebase you should be able to program in C++ and understand GTK.

6. Is this a big project? If you can, find out about how many lines of code
are in it, perhaps on [OpenHub](https://www.openhub.net/). <br>
	This is a large project with 629K lines of code. There are currently 92 contributors. 

7. Does the repository have tests? If so, are the code contributors expected to write tests for newly added code? <br>
	The repository does include various test. According to the contributing file, contributors are not expected write tests. Contributors are expected to fix bugs, report bugs, build new features, answer questions, and write articles supporting Inkscape.


## Code and Design Documentation
1. Is there clear documentation in the code itself? <br>
	Yes, from the code I have seen there is a lot of documentation.

2. Is there documentation about the design?  <br>
	Yes there is documentation about the design. There is less documentation about the design as compared to the code itself.

	-->
	48 days on average

5. Read the conversations from some open and some closed issues. Is there active discussion on the issues? <br>

	Take the five closed pull requests  (they can be most recently closed or a sample distributed over time) and look at when each was first created.
	Compute the number of days that each was open and take the average.
	-->
	On average within 2 to 3 days. 
12. Read the conversations from some open and some closed pull requests.  Is there active discussion on the pull requests? <br>

## Welcomeness and Community

1. Is there a CONTRIBUTING document? If so, how easy to read and understand is it?

## Summary
1. Do you think  this is a project to which it would be possible to contribute
in the course of a few weeks before the end of this semester? <br>
	<!--
	Explain your position. Do NOT simply say 'yes or 'no'.
	-->
	Unfortunately, I do not think someone would be able to contribute this in a course of few weeks unless they were familiar and comfortable with computer graphics. From the code, the project seems pretty complex and a great deal of background knowledge would be needed to contribute code. 

2. Would you be interested in contributing to this particular project? <br>
	<!--
	Explain why you would or would not be interested in contributing to this project. Do NOT simply say 'yes or 'no'.
	-->
	No, I would not like to contribute to this project. Even though I do have some knowledge of computer graphics, I do not think I have sufficient knowledge to work on this project.
