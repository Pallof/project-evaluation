## Project Data

1. Project description: <br>
	<!--
	What is the purpose of this project? What does the code do? What type of users
	does it have?
	-->
	This project is a Javascript library that allows you to add a coding editor into your application. This editor is very simplistic and allows users to drag and drop coding blocks to represent code instead of actually writing the code out. The editor will convert whatever the blocks say into the specified coding language with the correct syntax. This project was made to make coding easy and less intimidating since you do not need to know the syntax of the language you want to code in; you just need to know how to use the blocks and simple coding ideas. 
	
	Users of Blockly would integrate Blockly into their website to make their website a beginner-friendly code editor. People will then use these websites as an educational opportunity or a simple way to write code.

1. Project website/homepage:

	https://developers.google.com/blockly


1. Project repository:

	https://github.com/google/blockly


## License

1. What is the project's license? <br>
	<!--
	In most repositories there will be a file named LICENSE or something similar in
	the root level of the repository. This is the one to examine. There may be
	different licenses on specific files, but the project will have a main license.
	-->

	Apache 2.0



## Code Base


1. What is the primary programming language in the project?

	Javascript

1. What is the development environment? <br>
	<!--
	For example, is it Gnu C++ on Linux?
	Is it a Windows 10 application? Does one need to develop in a virtual machine?
	-->
	This is part of a web application so you just need a text editor. 

1. Are there instructions for how to download, build, and install? How easy is it
to find them? Do they seem easy (relatively speaking) to follow? <br>

	Most of the directions are not located in the repository, but there are a lot of instructions in the developers guide on their website. Easy to follow since you just have to download the code from their GitHub and then adding the script to your webpage. 

1. Does the project depend on external additional software modules such as
database,  graphics, web development, or other libraries? If so, are there clear instructions on how to install those? <br>

	Does not seem to have additional software modules. 

1. Is the code easy to understand? Browse some source code files and make
a judgment based on your random sample. <br>

	It seems hard to understand and will take a while to have a grasp of what's going on and what file is what. However, it is well commented. 

1. Is this a big project? If you can, find out about how many lines of code
are in it, perhaps on [OpenHub](https://www.openhub.net/). <br>

	Very big project. 144k lines of code

1. Does the repository have tests? If so, are the code contributors expected to write tests for newly added code? <br>

	There are tests. Contributers are expected to run the existing tests as well as write more. 


## Code and Design Documentation
1. Is there clear documentation in the code itself? <br>

	Yes, lots of comments throughout the code.

1. Is there documentation about the design?  <br>

	Yes, they provide [style guides](https://developers.google.com/blockly/guides/modify/web/style-guide)

	405

1. How long do issues stay open? <br>
	<!--
	Take the five closed issues (they can be most recently closed or a sample distributed over time) and look at when each was first reported.
	Compute the number of days that each was open and take the average.
	-->
	2 days

1. Read the conversations from some open and some closed issues. Is there active discussion on the issues? <br>

	Yes, and people respond really quickly.

1. Are issues tagged as easy, hard, for beginners, etc.? <br>

	No, tagged according to what section of the code has an issue

	Around 175

1. Do pull requests remain un-answered for a long time? <br>
	<!--
	Look at the closed pull requests to see how long they stayed open.
	Take the five closed pull requests  (they can be most recently closed or a sample distributed over time) and look at when each was first created.
	Compute the number of days that each was open and take the average.
	-->
	No, usually around 1 day.

1. Read the conversations from some open and some closed pull requests.  Is there active discussion on the pull requests? <br>

	Yes, and respond quickly. 

1. How many pull requests were opened within the past six months? <br>

	Around 500.

1. When was the last pull request  merged? <br>

## Welcomeness and Community

1. Is there a CONTRIBUTING document? If so, how easy to read and understand is it?
Look through it and see if it is clear and thorough. <br>

	It's easy to read, but I don't think it is very thorough. It seems very general. However, they do have more information on their developer site. 

1. Is there a CODE OF CONDUCT document? Does it have consequences for acts that
violate it? <br>

	The Code of Conduct is pretty general and does not really have any consequences other than the fact that they will handle it. 

1. Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues?
Are responses generally constructive? Read the issue conversations. <br>

	Responses are pretty constructive and quick. 

1. Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat? <br>

	Pretty friendly

1. Do maintainers thank people for their contributions? <br>

	Not really 


## Development Environment Installation

Install the development environment for the project on your system.
Describe the process that you needed to follow:

1. how involved was the process? <br>

	They pretty much told me step by step what to do. 

1. how long it take you? <br>

	Like 15 min

1. did you need to install additional packages or libraries? <br>

	Nope 

1. were you able to build the code following the instructions? <br>

	Yes

	No

1. any other comments? <br>

	The documentation and guides are very thorough




## Summary
1. Do you think this is a project to which it would be possible to contribute
in the course of a few weeks before the end of this semester? <br>
	<!--
	Explain your position. Do NOT simply say 'yes or 'no'.
	-->

	No. I think it will be very hard to contribute because most of the documentation is on their website so you won't be able to contribute to that. There is a lot of code to read through which will be very time consuming. There is already a large community so it will be hard to find an issue to raise. Additionally, there are actually very few commits recently which might be a sign it's hard to end up actually committing something. 


1. Would you be interested in contributing to this particular project? <br>
	<!--
	Explain why you would or would not be interested in contributing to this project. Do NOT simply say 'yes or 'no'.
	-->

	Not really because I think it will be very hard to find something to contribute to. I think I would want to contribute to a project with a smaller community. Additionally, I have only seen and never have used this project before so I do not have a lot of experience with it which might make it harder to work with as well. However, I do like the fact that this is written in Javascript, which is one of the languages I am more familiar with.
