=====================

**Evaluating Person or Team**: Ryan Li @ryanhanli ---

Project Data
------------

1.  Project description: Open Food Facts is a free, open and collaborative database of
	food products from around the world. It contains information about food products
	such as calories, nutritional value, and etc.

2.  Project website/homepage: <https://world.openfoodfacts.org/>

3.  Project repository: <https://github.com/openfoodfacts/openfoodfacts-server>

License
-------

1.  What is the project\'s license? ODC Open Database License v1.0

Code Base
---------

1.  What is the primary programming language in the project?

    There are many different wrapper APIs coded in different languages, but they
	are in their own repository.  For the repository I 
	chose(<https://github.com/openfoodfacts/openfoodfacts-server>), the main
	programming language is HTML if you consider it a programming language.  
	Otherwise, Perl is the primary programming language.  The repository 
	consists of 94.2% HTML, but if one doesn't consider HTML a programming language, 
	Perl is the primary programming language even though it only consists of 5.4% 
	of the repository.

2.  What is the development environment?

    Docker and Travis CI

3.  Are there instructions for how to download, build, and install? How
    easy is it to find them? Do they seem easy (relatively speaking) to
    follow?

    The README file has a link which directs you to a step by step tutorial
	on how to download, build, and install Product Opener which is the server
	software for Open Food Facts.  They seem quite easy to follow,
	and if you're stuck the README file also includes a link to the official
	Slack group.  The actual database can be found on their main website to
	download as well.  The instructions are easy to follow and they formatted
	the data for you already into CSV or a MongoDB dump.

4.  Does the project depend on external additional software modules such
    as database, graphics, web development, or other libraries? If so,
    are there clear instructions on how to install those?

    Requires many Perl modules, Apache, and MongoDB.  There are clear instructions
	on how to install all of these in the installation page the README links to.

5.  Is the code easy to understand? Browse some source code files and
    make a judgment based on your random sample.

    Based off judgment from a random sample, the code looks pretty easy to understand.
	Everything is commented and formatted nicely.

6.  Is this a big project? If you can, find out about how many lines of
    code are in it, perhaps on [OpenHub](https://www.openhub.net/).

    500,000+ lines of code.  This is a big project.

7.  Does the repository have tests? If so, are the code contributors
    expected to write tests for newly added code?

    Yes. It is not a requirement, but highly encouraged.

Development Environment Installation
------------------------------------

Install the development environment for the project on your system.
Describe the process that you needed to follow:

1.  How involved was the process?

    Not much I just followed the instructions step by step on the abovementioned
	website and it worked (This is for Product Opener the server software).  The
	database itself was even easier to download I just downloaded the CSV file
	straight to my computer and that was it.

2.  How long it take you?

    30 minutes for the Product Opener and about 10 for the CSV file.  I did these
	two concurrently.

3.  Did you need to install additional packages or libraries?

    Yes, but only for the product opener.  I already had Excel on my computer to open
	the CSV file.

4.  Were you able to build the code following the instructions?

    Yes.

5.  Did you need to look for additional help in installing the
    environment?

    No, the instructions were enough.

6.  Any other comments?

    N/A

Summary
-------

1.  Do you think this is a project to which it would be possible to
    contribute in the course of a few weeks before the end of this
    semester?

    Yes. Some of the links the Github links to (Wiki pages) have a lot of typos,
	and fixing those would be a good start.

2.  Would you be interested in contributing to this particular project?

    Yes.  It seems like the project supports all the popular languages, and the
	database itself would be useful to me in the future.  Additionally, the
	community is very inviting and helpful it seems.
