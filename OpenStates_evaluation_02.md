## Project Data


1. Project description: <br>
	Purpose: "Open States strives to improve civic engagement at the state level by providing data and tools regarding state legislatures. We aim to serve members of the public, activist groups, journalists, and researchers with better data on what is happening in their state capital, and to provide tools to reduce barriers to participation and increase engagement."

	The code scapes data from every state regarding bills, available sessions, breakdown of senators and assemblymembers, and committees. 

	OpenStates users would be people who are looking to get more informed about what is going on in their state politically.

## Code Base


1. What is the primary programming language in the project?

	99.9% of this project is in Python. The other 0.1% is not specified but I think it's just the config / yaml / markdown files like the readme. 

2. What is the development environment? <br>
	
	This is a python web scraper. All someone needs to write code is Python and Docker. To run it a web browser, and internet are needed. 
	<!--
	For example, is it Gnu C++ on Linux?
	Is it a Windows 10 application? Does one need to develop in a virtual machine?
	-->

3. Are there instructions for how to download, build, and install? How easy is it to find them? Do they seem easy (relatively speaking) to follow? <br>
	
	The instructions to get the code are easy. Everything that the code does can be seen on their website as they display all info scraped there. 

4. Does the project depend on external additional software modules such as
database,  graphics, web development, or other libraries? If so, are there clear instructions on how to install those? <br>

	No. 

5. Is the code easy to understand? Browse some source code files and make
a judgment based on your random sample. <br>

	The code is extremely easy to understand as it is mostly simple Python web scrapers. 

6. Is this a big project? If you can, find out about how many lines of code
are in it, perhaps on [OpenHub](https://www.openhub.net/). <br>

	According to OpenHub, appoximately 30k lines of code. 

7. Does the repository have tests? If so, are the code contributors expected to write tests for newly added code? <br>

	It would not appear if contributors are expected to write tests but they are expected to test their code. 


## Code and Design Documentation
1. Is there clear documentation in the code itself? <br>

	There is very little if any documentation in the random sample of code I have looked at. 

2. Is there documentation about the design?  <br>

	There is clear documentation about the design in the docs.

	Compute the number of days that each was open and take the average.
	-->

12. Read the conversations from some open and some closed pull requests.  Is there active discussion on the pull requests? <br>

## Development Environment Installation

Install the development environment for the project on your system.
Describe the process that you needed to follow:

1. how involved was the process? <br>

	Installing their development environment is extremely easy and they provide clear instructions for Mac, Windows, and Linux. They then provide easy instructions for cloniing their repository and begining to work with their code. 

2. how long it take you? <br>

	It took me about 3 minutes to get everything set up. I just followed the instructions on their website. 

3. did you need to install additional packages or libraries? <br>

	I needed to install Docker and pre-commit on my laptop to do this. 

4. were you able to build the code following the instructions? <br>

	Yes, they provide clear instructions for doing everything (very minumal effort needed from the user). 

5. did you need to look for additional help in installing the environment? <br>

	I did not need to look for any additional help when installing the environment.

## Summary
1. Do you think  this is a project to which it would be possible to contribute
in the course of a few weeks before the end of this semester? <br>

	I think this is a project that would be easy to contrubute to over the course of a few weeks and definitely before the end of the semester. I think a major upgrade we could easily make in this class is adding documentation to all of the code as very little currently exists. Another clear upgrade needed is a more extensive readme rather than just links to other sources where the info exists. I also think that it wouldn't be too tough to understand and write more code for this project in that amount of time.

2. Would you be interested in contributing to this particular project? <br>

	I wouldn't say I'm super stoked on this project but I definitely wouldn't be opposed to working on it. It's clearly an important resource that people should be taking advantage of.
