9. Is the code easy to understand? Browse some source code files and make
a judgment based on your random sample. <br>

	The code is not easy to understand, not because its hard to understand, but because its so massive. There's so many components that reading the documentation is necessary to understand the linkage between different components.

	For the most part, there is in-depth documentation throughout the code. There are some portions that are more densely documented than others.
